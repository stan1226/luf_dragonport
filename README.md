Luna Unity Frames Dragonportrait

This edited version of Luna Unit Frames for WoW 1.12 allows you to add the Rare or Elite Dragonportrait indicator to your player for the player and target unitframe. Choose the Silver version for the rare and the Gold version for the elite background. 

To activate the dragonportraits go to the Luna Unit Frames options in the game. In the Player and Target section you will find a new checkbox for the Dragonportrait. Activate it and move and resize it as you prefer.
