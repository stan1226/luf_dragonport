Luna Unit Frames Dragon v1.1

This edited version of Luna Unit Frames for WoW 1.12 allows you to add the Rare or Elite Dragonportrait indicator to your player for the player and target unitframe. 

To activate the dragonportraits go to the Luna Unit Frames options in the game. In the Player and Target section you will find a new checkbox for the Dragon Rare and Dragon Elite. Activate it and move and resize it as you prefer.

Additional Fixes that were broken in the orignial 1.12 port:
- XP now correctly fills the full width for 100% xp, before the 100% value was only about 80% of the bar

Installation:
- Place the LunaUnitFrames folder into your wow/Interface/AddOns folder
